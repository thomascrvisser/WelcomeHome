# WelcomeHome

Tired of looking for BYU-Approved housing by sifting through websites of different complexes, finally finding a phone number to call, only to find out it is out of your price range or there is no vacancy? WelcomeHome is a centralized listing of all BYU-approved housing openings which can be sorted through by many factors such as price range, shared/private rooms, etc...
 
## Business

This service would be contracted and funded by BYU. Any housing that wants to be BYU approved needs to go through us. Could potentially charge apartments/houses a fee to be shown on this list.
 
## Legal

Ideally, Welcome Home would be owned and funded by BYU. It would be closed source all of which would belong to BYU and follow their privacy and copyright laws.
 
## Technical

WelcomeHome would be primarily a web based project using any sort of web framework. It would use MySQL or SQLite as its database. Possibly could be ported to an IOS or Android application.
