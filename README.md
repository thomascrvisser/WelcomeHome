# WelcomeHome

Tired of looking for BYU-Approved housing by sifting through websites of different complexes, finally finding a phone number to call, only to find out it is out of your price range or there is no vacancy? Welcome Home is a centralized listing of all BYU-approved housing openings, price ranges, and phone numbers.
 
##Business
This service would be contracted and funded by BYU. Any housing that wants to be BYU approved needs to go through us.
 
##Legal
Ideally, Welcome Home would be owned and funded by BYU. It would be closed source all of which would belong to BYU and follow their privacy and copyright laws.
 
##Technical
Welcome Home would be primarily a web based project using any sort of web framework using MySQL or SQLite. Possibly could be ported to an IOS or Android application.
